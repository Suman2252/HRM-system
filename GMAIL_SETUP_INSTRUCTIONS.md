# 📧 Gmail Setup Instructions - Receive Real Emails!

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Why You're Not Getting Emails**

Your HRM system **IS WORKING PERFECTLY** - emails are being sent successfully! However, they're currently going to a **test email service** instead of your real Gmail inbox.

## 🔧 **Quick Fix - 3 Simple Steps:**

### **Step 1: Get Gmail App Password**
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click **Security** (left sidebar)
3. Enable **2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled)
4. Scroll down to **App passwords**
5. Click **App passwords**
6. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)**
7. Type "HRM System" as the name
8. Click **Generate**
9. **Copy the 16-character password** (like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### **Step 2: Update Configuration**
Edit the file: `/Users/gokulben/Downloads/HRM-system-main/server/.env`

Replace these lines:
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
```

With your actual details:
```env
EMAIL_USER=youremail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

### **Step 3: Restart Server**
```bash
cd /Users/gokulben/Downloads/HRM-system-main/server
npm start
```
